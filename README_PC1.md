# Progress

## Propose a Research Topic

**Project Topic:** Exploring the relationship between food access and
health outcomes across a variety of geographic levels

**Project Description:** Our group wants to investigate how disparities
in food access related to differences in community health outcomes
across the United States. Using census-tract level data from the CDC
PLACES dataset and the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, we will look at
these relationships on a variety of levels - national, state, and even
the city level. Measures of food accessibility include proximity to
grocery stores (which help identify food deserts) and low-income
population indicators. Health outcomes studied are rates of obesity,
diabetes, and mental health levels. We hope to identify geographic
patterns or correlations that explain the impact of food insecurity on
public health.

## Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration.

Our GitHub repository has been established with editing rights limited
to team members, while viewing rights are open to the public.

One challenge we faced was making sure all members of the team had
access to the repository. Another challenge was orienting ourselves to
the GitHub interface. Spending time this week collaborating via GitHub
has started to increase our familiarity with the site.

## Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources

## Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination

## Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data

## Submit draft of progress at Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2.

## Summarize your findings in a short video presentation.

## Publish a detailed, well formatted markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub repository.
